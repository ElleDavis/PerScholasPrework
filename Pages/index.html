    <p id="aboutMe">
        My name is Shanitrice Ella-Leonne Davis but please can call me Elle. 
        I've recently relocated back to Atlanta and I've worked in the Youth Development and Education sector in Boston since 2015; I am curently learning more about technology and hope to transition into the sector as a Software Engineer.
        I love being creative and often enjoy being outside playing team sports or doing leisurely activities such as soaking up the sun.
